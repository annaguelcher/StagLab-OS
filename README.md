# StagLab-OpenSky

StagLab-OpenSky is a developer version branched from StagLab 6.0 (https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/staglab).
This version is intended for developers to add and trackchange their individual routines to StagLab themselves. Some of additions will find their way into the original version of StagLab, others will remain in this version accessible to other users.

Currently, due to time restrictions, testing of new additions is up to the developers themselves.

# AG-MantleDomains 

The branch "AG-MantleDomains" is a StagLab-OpenSky developer branch maintained by Anna GÃ¼lcher (ETH Zuerich). She has written additional features in the toolbox that allow for detailed mantle domain detection, plotting thereof, and histogram-analysis. This branch is correlated to the toolbox used for the manuscript "Guelcher, A. J. P., et al., (2022), Fast, narrow, and "cold" plumes due to strain-weakening rheology in Earth's lower mantle, Geochemistry, Geosystems, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GC010314".
